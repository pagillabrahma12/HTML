        <dd>Venkat, an unemployed youngster, meets Sailaja, a middle-class beauty, on a train journey, and they are immediately attracted to each other after dancing in a rain shower. At the same time, Sailaja catches the eye of Bhadranna, a dangerous, ruthless politician who also fell in love with her. Venkat keeps bumping into Sailaja every time it rains, and they fall in love. Ranga Rao, Sailaja's father, is a typical black sheep with many bad habits. Bhadranna approaches him with the marriage proposal, and Ranga Rao jumps on that and agrees. Later, a film producer Seenayya approaches Ranga Rao with an offer for Sailaja to act in a movie. Ranga Rao thinks that acting in films would be more lucrative than marrying her off to Bhadranna. He first successfully creates clashes between lovers, convinces Sailaja to act in a movie, and leaves with her to the city. Venkat also leaves for Vizag to his uncle's place</dd>
