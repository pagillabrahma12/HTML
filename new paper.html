<h2><mark>Chandrayaan-3 is on its journey to the moon.</mark></h2>
<p>The Lander Module (LM) of the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) third lunar mission Chandrayaan-3, <u>launched on July 14<sup>th</sup>, made a successfully landing on the Moon's surface on August 23<sup>th</sup></u>,<b>making India only the fourth country</b> after the erstwhile USSR, the U.S. and China to make a soft landing on the lunar surface. With the successful landing of the Lander Module of ISRO’s third lunar mission Chandrayaan-3, India has reached the Moon!<i> It has also became the first country to land near the Moon’s south pole.</i> Congratulating the team of scientists at ISRO, PM Modi said, “India’s successful moon mission is not India’s alone...Our approach of one earth, one family one future is resonating across the globe...Moon mission is based on the same human centric approach. So, this success belongs to all of humanity.”<br>
Precisely at 6.03 p.m. the lander touched the lunar surface and there was euphoric celebrations at the Mission Operations Complex (MOX) at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking, and Command Network (ISTRAC), Bengaluru. Following this, the Lander successfully deployed the Rover which will carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The Lander and the Rover with a mission life of one Lunar day (14 Earth days) have scientific payloads to carry out experiments on the lunar surface</p>
<p>Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in <ins>safe landing and roving</ins> on the lunar surface.<del> It consists of Lander and Rover configuration</del>. It will be launched by LVM3 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota. The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. The propulsion module has <b>Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth</b> (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit.</p>
<h3>The mission objectives of Chandrayaan-3 are:</h3>
<p>To demonstrate Safe and Soft Landing on Lunar Surface</p>
<p>To demonstrate Rover roving on the moon and</p>
<p>To conduct in-situ scientific experiments.</p>
